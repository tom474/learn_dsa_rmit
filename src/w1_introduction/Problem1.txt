1.1/ Find the largest number in an array

Input: Array A[0...N-1]
Output: The largest number in A
Assumption: All elements are unique

largest = A[0]
for i = 1 to N-1
    if largest < A[i]
        largest = A[i]
return largest


// Alternative version: Find the location of the largest number
// Useful if the "number" is an object with many attributes
// and the value we use for comparison is just one attribute

largestIdx = 0
for i = 1 to N-1
    if A[largestIdx] < A[i]
        largestIdx = i
return largestIdx

1.2/ Find the 2nd-largest number in an array

Input: Array A[0...N-1]
Output: The 2nd-largest number in A
Assumption: All elements are unique, N >= 2

if A[0] > A[1]
    largest = A[0]
    second = A[1]
else
    largest = A[i]
    second = A[0]

for i = 2 to N-1
    if largest < A[i]
        second = largest
        largest = A[i]
    else if second < A[i]
        second = A[i]
return second


// Alternative version: Find the location of the second-largest number

if A[0] > A[1]
    largestIdx = 0
    secondIdx = 1
else
    largestIdx = i
    secondIdx = 0

for i = 2 to N-1
    if A[largestIdx] < A[i]
        second = largestIdx
        largest = i
    else if A[secondIdx] < A[i]
        second = i
return secondIdx


// Second approach:
// Find the largest number
// Exchange the largest number with A[N-1] (The last element)
// Find the largest number from 0 to N-2 only => it is the 2nd-largest number
